# Diagnostic Analysis of Breast Cancer using Machine Learning Algorithms      
                        
Goals of Project:                                                                        
                                          
* KNN is quite a good classifier but its performance depends on the value of k. It gives poor results for lower values of k and best results as the value of k increases.
* PCA is more sensitive to SVM than kNN .As the value of Principle Component (PC) is increased, SVM gives better results and accuracy score is more than kNN.
* It can be seen that as the training data size increases, SVM performs better than kNN and has more accuracy.

Early detection of cancer is often difﬁcult because the symptoms of the disease at the beginning are absent. Thus, it is necessary to discover and interpret new knowledge to prevent and minimize the risk adverse consequences.                        
In this project, we have used certain classification methods such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is a supervised learning method to detect breast cancer.       
In artiﬁcial intelligent, machine learning is a discipline which allows the machine to evolve through a process. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant. Inregarding the technique we used in Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems.       
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very wellk- Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) classification technique is a non- parametric method used for classification.In this classification, the output is a class membership.
An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
